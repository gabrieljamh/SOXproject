Hello everyone, since I've got my backup, I started developing a script to convert the EOS Data to usable data for TavernAI and other compatible AI platforms. have tested out and the only thing it can't do is import the avatar, that you will need to download manualy.

Name S.O.X. is a parody to S.O.S. and is also the short for Save Our Xouls

Current Development state: Need Testing
S.O.X. Toolbox:
Xoul/Character Conversion Tool
Persona Adding Tool
Lorebook Conversion Tool
Scenario Conversion Tool
Chat Conversion Tools (Multi and Single in different tools)

It's a completely fanmade tool by someone who love the community and want to help the community to keep their story growing.

- Why migrating to SillyTaverm?

Mostly for stability, local LLMs are active as long as you have it running on your PC, meaning you won't need to relay on AI platforms that may close and you lose all of your data again. SillyTavern is also higly customizable making your experience unique the way you want

# HOW TO USE:

Basically, the best way to use is using the source code PY scripts, they are more update always, but for that, you need python installed and pyqt5 dependency:

get python and install pyqt5 with this:
```
pip install pyqt5
```
then run the script using:
```
python <SCRIPT>.py
```
you may also need requests to run the extra tools:
```
pip install requests
```

*You can always also use the standalone versions on Releases tab
